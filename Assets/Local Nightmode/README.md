# Local Nightmode
Version 1.0

# Overview
This is the avatar built-in night mode.  
It is intended for use with VRChat Avatar 3.0.  
You can also use it with Avatar 2.0, but you will need to install EmoteSwitch separately.

# How to use - SDK3.0
1. Right click your avatar on Hierarchy and select `Setup Local Nightmode`.
2. `Build and Publish` your avatar which has `_NightMode` appended to the name.

# How to use - SDK2.0
1. Right click your avatar on Hierarchy and select `Setup Local Nightmode`.
2. Use EmoteSwitch to switch the `Mesh` in `2.0_LocalNightmode` to complete the installation.

# Warning
If there are too many parameters in ExpressionParameters, you cannot install.  
If you get a warning, delete one of the parameters.  
Also, since Local Nightmode depends on the VRChat specifications, it may not be usable in the future due to specification changes.
